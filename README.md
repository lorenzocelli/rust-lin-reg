# Linear Regression with Rust

This project implements a simple ordinary least squares linear regression model in Rust. It leverages [ndarray](https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray) to store data points and [ndarray-linalg](https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray-linalg) to solve the linear system.

The sample csv dataset comes from the online resources of the book ['Introduction to Statistical Learning'](https://www.statlearning.com/resources-python).
